This is using a CHI12 paper as inspiration.

Pay Attention! Designing Adaptive Agents that
Monitor and Improve User Engagement
Dan Szafir, Bilge Mutlu


The key finding is that task engagement is positively correlated by a measure, E, which is calculated as Beta over (Alpha + Theta)

The idea is that at the start of a study session this will be high, but then waver as attention flags as the study session goes on.
